It also has metadata for each airport and runway:

## Being a developer

To run the Python scripts, you'll need to load the dependencies in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To build the wrangled and sqlized data (i.e. `data/faa_airport_boardings.sqlite`) from the data stored in [data/stashed](data/stashed), run:

```sh
make ALL
```

To fetch the data from the FAA website â€“ which necessitates manually fixing the [data/stashed/airport_data/manual_fix/airports.xls](data/stashed/airport_data/manual_fix/airports.xls) and [data/stashed/airport_data/manual_fix/runways.xls](data/stashed/airport_data/manual_fix/runways.xls), run:

```sh
make REBOOT
```
